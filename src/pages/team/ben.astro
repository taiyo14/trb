              I am currently the President of the Trust & Wealth Management
            Division at Texas Regional Bank, a privately held bank in Texas. At
            TRB Trust & Wealth Management, we are focused on providing
            comprehensive and customized solutions for high-net-worth clients.
            The mission of our team is to deliver Informed Peace of Mind by
            helping clients achieve their goals and protect their legacy, while
            upholding the highest standards of integrity, professionalism, and
            fiduciary responsibility.
            <br />
            <br />
            Prior to joining Texas Regional Bank, I was a Senior Vice President and
            Senior Fiduciary Officer at Northern Trust Corporation, where I managed
            a portfolio of complex trust accounts, advised clients on personal finance
            and wealth transfer strategies, and collaborated with internal and external
            partners to deliver exceptional service. Before that I practiced law
            at Bracewell LLP and Gray, Reed & McGraw LLP.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am board certified in estate planning and probate and hold a J.D. from
            South Texas College of Law and an undergraduate degree in Business Management
            from Mays Business School at Texas A&M University.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I am not in the office, you will typically find me enjoying time
            with my wife and three young children, ideally in the mountains in Colorado,
            or playing golf. We are active members at Memorial Drive Presbyterian
            Church in Houston.
