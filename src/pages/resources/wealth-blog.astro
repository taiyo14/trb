          The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4, 2025,
          ushers in sweeping tax reforms with a special impact on the nation&apos;s
          wealthiest families. Here&apos;s a quick overview of some headline
          provisions that matter most to high-net-worth households:
        </p>
        <h5 class="font-bold mt-[1rem] mb-[1rem]">
          Increased Estate & Gift Tax Exemptions
        </h5>
        <p>
          The lifetime exemption for estate and gift taxes is permanently
          boosted to $15 million for individuals and $30 million for couples,
          indexed for inflation. This means wealthy families can now transfer a
          much greater portion of their assets tax-free, both during life and at
          death.
        </p>
        <h5 class="font-bold mt-[1rem] mb-[1rem]">
          Enhanced Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) Exclusions
        </h5>
        <p>
          Entrepreneurs and investors benefit hugely: the exclusion for gains
          from QSBS jumps from $10 million to $15 million per issuer, or 10x
          basisâ€”whichever is greater. A phased approach means 100% of eligible
          gains are tax-free after holding QSBS for five years. The bill also
          widens the pool of businesses qualifying for this break.
        </p>
        <h5 class="font-bold mt-[1rem] mb-[1rem]">
          Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Relief
        </h5>
        <p>
          The bill makes the higher exemption thresholds and faster phase-outs
          from the AMT permanent, sparing many affluent families from this
          parallel tax system on their complex returns.
        </p>
        <h5 class="font-bold mt-[1rem] mb-[1rem]">
          Real Estate & Business Expensing
        </h5>
        <p>
          New rules allow 100% up-front expensing for certain commercial
          properties, helping families with substantial business interests and
          real estate portfolios write off investments immediately.
        </p>
        <h5 class="font-bold mt-[1rem] mb-[1rem]">
          Permanent Increase in Child Tax Credit
        </h5>
        <p>
          While this sounds middle-class, wealthier families with younger heirs
          benefit from a higher maximum child tax credit (now $2,200), which can
          help offset taxes on trusts and family wealth management strategies.
        </p>
        <h5 class="font-bold mt-[1rem] mb-[1rem]">
          No Expansion of Certain Deductions
        </h5>
        <p>
          The bill does not extend some previously discussed deductions (such as
          interest-related dividend breaks for business development companies),
          so tax planning will remain important in these areas.
        </p>
        <h5 class="font-bold mt-[1rem] mb-[1rem]"> In Summary </h5>
        <p>
          For wealthy American families, the One Big Beautiful Bill delivers
          lasting boosts to estate planning, business growth, and tax
          efficiency, creating clearer paths to passing wealth through
          generations and investing with less tax drag. Consult with your
          advisor to ensure you&apos;re harnessing the new rules to their fullest!
